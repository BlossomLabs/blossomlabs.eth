With it, you can bundle many DAO operations into just one script, generating a singular transaction, usually a vote. These commands include installing or upgrading apps, changing their permissions, executing actions or interacting with external contracts.

        Unbreakable Vows are private legal contracts that can be created and signed by parties to give legitimacy to peer to peer agreements. In the Harry Potterâ€™s Wizarding World, an unbreakable vow is a type of binding magical contract cast between two parties, that if broken by either party, would result in the imminent death of whoever broke the contract. In the web3 world, the party who breaks the vow only loses some collateral (tokens, NFTs, etc).
